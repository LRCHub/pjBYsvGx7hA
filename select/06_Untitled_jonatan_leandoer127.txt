I went to see what I could find
I went to see what I could find
I went to see what I could find
I went to see what I could find
I went to see what I could find
A place in heaven on my mind
Highway nightmares out here there's no time
I'm a red road vampire I see what I can find
I went to see what I could find
A place in heaven on my mind
Highway nightmares out here there's no time
I'm a red road vampire I see what I find
You smell like watermelon mixed with grape wine
There's no-one like you, you're one of a kind
Highway nightmares out here there's no time
There's no time I went to see what I could find
