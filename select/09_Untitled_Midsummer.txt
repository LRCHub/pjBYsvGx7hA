I'll be everything you wanted
I just have to go away now for a while
And I promise I won't break it
I'll treat it like a fragile little child

And we'll find a way to make it
Just like we always do

I'll take you to the west coast
Where we can finally see the sea
And maybe we can stay there
And finally be alone just you and me

And we'll find a way to make it
Just like we always do

Just like we always do
